# Collins C. (@damzydevsec)

Software Engineer specializing in DevSecOps. I build secure, high-performance, and resilient applications by integrating security into the entire development lifecycle.

> 95% of security breaches are not caused by nation-state hackers, but by common, preventable mistakes made during the development cycle. My mission is to find and fix those mistakes before they reach production.

### 🛡️ My Portfolio of Proof

This is my active foundry. It is the evidence of my work. As these projects are completed, they will be pinned to my profile.

1.  **[Project 1: The Secure-by-Design API]** *(In Progress)*
    * A REST API built in [Language] that is secure by default. It demonstrates input validation, rate limiting, and secure authentication.
2.  **[Project 2: The DevSecOps Pipeline]** *(Planning Phase)*
    * A full CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that automatically runs SAST (Snyk/CodeQL) and container (Trivy) scans, failing the build on critical vulnerabilities.
3.  **[Project 3: The "Break and Fix"]** *(Planning Phase)*
    * A "live-fire" fork of a deliberately vulnerable application. This repo contains my penetration test report and the pull request that patches the security flaws.
