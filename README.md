# Hi, I'm Collins C. 👋

I am a Software Engineer specializing in DevSecOps. I build secure, automated, and resilient systems.

This GitHub is my public foundry, where I document my work and build my "Portfolio of Proof."



### 🛡️ My Portfolio of Proof

This is my active work. These projects demonstrate my ability to build, secure, and automate.

1.  **[Project 1: The Secure-by-Design API]** *(In Progress)*
    * A REST API built in [Language] that is secure by default. It demonstrates input validation, rate limiting, and secure authentication.
2.  **[Project 2: The DevSecOps Pipeline]** *(Planning Phase)*
    * A full CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that automatically runs SAST (Snyk/CodeQL) and container (Trivy) scans, failing the build on critical vulnerabilities.
3.  **[Project 3: The "Break and Fix"]** *(Planning Phase)*
    * A "live-fire" fork of a deliberately vulnerable application. This repo contains my penetration test report and the pull request that patches the security flaws.



### 🛠️ My Core Technology Stack

* **Backend:** [Your culled list, e.g., Go, Python (Django), PHP (Laravel)]
* **DevOps & Cloud:** [Your culled list, e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions]
* **Security:** [The tools you are mastering, e.g., Nmap, Trivy, Snyk, CodeQL]
